The Smart Crop Monitoring System is an IoT-based project designed to monitor environmental conditions in agricultural fields. The system continuously collects real-time sensor data and sends it to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for monitoring and analysis. This project was developed and simulated using Wokwi, making it cost-effective and suitable for smart agriculture applications.
